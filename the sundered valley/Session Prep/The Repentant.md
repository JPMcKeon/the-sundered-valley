## *The Repentant
*A ship of the dead, washed ashore in the Sundered Valley from a planet far away. The oars creak a ghouls wail, the sails whisper death songs of lost sailors.

The Repentant is a 3-masted galleon with three decks. A top deck, a gun deck, and a galley of oars. Designed with a shallow draft for navigating far up inland waterways, the Repentant was originally commissioned with exploratory missions in search of resources and furs. After being decommissioned the ship was purchased by a radical religious sect and crewed with pilgrims on a grim voyage of castigation and supplication. 

The Repentant is currently lodged some 25 feet above the canyon floor between two flat granite walls.
