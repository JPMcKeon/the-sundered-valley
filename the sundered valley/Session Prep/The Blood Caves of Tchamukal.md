[[Tchamukal]], an Angel who became obsessed with mortality and embarked on a quest of necromantic magic to incorporate a beating heart and blood into his body. The blood caves are the remnants of his laboratory built into the cliffs over the Sundered Valley. Now abandoned, the temple complex holds macabre reminders of its previous purpose. The complex has become inhabited by various subterranean creatures including giant centipedes, oozes, stirges and the ghosts and zombies of the god’s sacrificial victims. Recently, while excavating a vein of quicksilver, a clan of Kobolds who are in love with Orgmog, troll chieftain, have broken through the wall into the main ceremonial chamber of the temple. 

Temple Occupants:

1. Tchamukal: once a widely revered blood God, Tchamukal’s name is now mostly unknown outside of scholarly circles. The temple was once a sacrificial site to the God where “willing” sacrifices were drugged with a potion of False Death and then bled out of large stone altars before the gathered faithful. Tchamukal’s presence still lingers in the central chamber and may become a PC’s patron if the PC acquires either a chain of Tchamukal or communes with the deity in another manner (i.e. blood sacrifice). Tchamukal is hungry for worshippers and will meet reasonable requests by potential followers, though their taste for blood may soon sour any relationship. 
    
2. Ormog: A troll chieftain, Ormog wears an enchanted turtle shell as a necklace. The shell causes creatures to fall in love with Ormog. A clan of Kobold’s are currently enchanted by Ormog’s talisman and are serving as his body guard, servants and harem. The Kobolds were mining quicksilver for Ormog (his favorite delicacy) when they inadvertently broke through the wall of the main ceremonial chamber. Tchamukal is annoyed at their presence and will reward PCs for cleansing his temple of the Kobolds. 
    
3. Bert’s Bastards: A roving band of mercenary treasure seekers made entrance to the temple some days ago. They were stricken deaf after misusing the singing bowl in room 3. Some of Bert’s Bastards may survive in the temple but most were picked off by Kobolds in their initial confusion. 
    
4. Archons of Tchamukal: 3 Statues oversee the sacrificial slabs. Each holds a polearm and an outstretched hand. They will strike anyone who gets on to a slab. A valuable or blood crossing the outstretched palm will cause the s
    
5. Flairol: the lab assistant of the angel/mage Tchamukal. Became disgruntled, collected a satchel of artifacts and tried to abscond. He was captured and killed by the archons of Tchamukal but not before locking Tchamukal into his heart chamber. His satchel sits on the pedestal on
    

Areas:

1. Storage Room: Roots break the walls, full of large clay pots containing hemlock, resin and covered in a dusty flag bearing a rising sun crest (20c).
    
2. Apothecary: fireplace on one wall with cauldron, 10’ pole leans nearby. On the walls hang rusty Shears of Rending (2,000 c). In the center of the room is a mirror table (10,000 c). Clay pots line the far wall filled with belladonna. (Secret door to 3)
    
3. Tone Room: A broken chandelier has strewn glass and crystal shards across the floor. An upholstered wooden pedestal holds a brass singing bowl and striker. On the facing wall is engraved the recipe for a potion of false death. (Secret door to 2)
    
4. Draught Chamber: A plain bed is the only furniture. The bed has a mundane handkerchief and a half-empty bottle of rum on it. A search reveals a spy hole in one wall, listening to the hole reveals the sound of gnashing/eating. 
    
5. Mine Entrance: the hole where the Kobolds have broken through. The entrance is blocked with a crude screen of woven thorn branches. The air in the mine shaft is very thin and polluted due to Kobold Mining Technology. Entering the mine is noticed by 2d12 Kobolds and Ormog arrives after 2 rounds. 
    
6. Grand Arch: The main entrance to the ceremonial chamber, the grand archway is surrounded by bas relief of the Archons of Tchamukal celebrating the rites of exsanguination. The archway reads “Flow My Heart to Tchamukal” 
    
7. Collection Pool: A font where the blood from sacrifices on the altars collects for ritual purposes. The pool is now occupied by a black pudding. The black pudding surrounds a low pedestal upon which an embroidered satchel sits. Crude chalk markings are on the floor surrounding the pool show a plan for extracting the satchel from the black pudding. 
    
8. Altars: 3 large granite slabs with channels cut in their faces are attended by 20 ft tall Archons of Tchamukal. 
    
9. Secret Door: To stairs UP to viewing balcony. The balcony allowed priests of Tchamukal to observe the attendant worshippers during ceremonies. The balcony is now home to a nest of Stirges. 
    
10. Tchamukal’s Study: The angel-mage’s study, walls lined with spellbooks. PCs can take 2 spellbooks, the 3rd triggers a shocking trap lightning trap. Each book taken of a shelf the PC gets a slight tingle in their fingers and sees rolling electricity across the shelves. 
    

Items of Note:

Mirror Table (10,000c): Studying the mirror r eveals the surface is liquid like quicksilver. Anything that touches the mirror table becomes stuck to the mirror permanently. Resisting the tensity of the mirror requires STR vs 15 to avoid more being pulled into the liquid mirror. The mirror permanently coats everything it touches and effectively “chromes” the items or body parts. The Shears of Rending can cut the mirror off the attached item but the chroming effect remains permanently causing the item to be reflective.

Shears of Rending (2,000c): Rusted iron tinsnips hang from a hook on the wall. The shears can cut the liquid mirror and free any trapped creatures. The shears 

Tuning Bowl (1000c): Priests of Tchamukal used the bowl to send worshippers into a stupor preventing nasty outbreaks during sacrifices. Running the striker around the rim puts all within earshot (WIS vs 15) into a torpor for 1 turn. Striking the bowl causes a deafening sound (CON vs 15 or deaf for X turns. X=miss/2 minimum 1 turn)
