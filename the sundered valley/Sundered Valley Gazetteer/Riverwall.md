[[Riverwall]]: The home city of the adventuring party. Riverwall was founded on the banks of the __ River after the cataclysmic sundering of the valley. Riverwall is so named due to itâ€™s geography where the town occupies a bight in the river and land access is closed by a long wall. Riverwall is occupied by the human and demi-human residents of the region and holds sovereignty over the known Sundered Valley. The city is managed by leaders of the three main factions, The Risen, The Sanguine, and The Founders.
