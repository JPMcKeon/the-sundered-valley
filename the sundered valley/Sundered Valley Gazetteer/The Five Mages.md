# The Five Mages
Tchamukal: The Blood Lich. Tchamukal's experimentation was focused around the sanguinary arts, utilizing a well-spring of dragonic blood to concoct various elixirs and potions seeking to enhance, lengthen and mutate mortal lives. Tchamukal maintained a devoted cult of human followers and kobold assistants who worked with him on his experiments. The so-called "Blood Caves of Tchamukal" is the ruins of his laboratory and religious venue where he would gather his devoted for acts of obeisance, revelation of new experimental results and to bask in general adulation. After The Sundering, Tchamukal was separated from his much-modified and mutated physical body. His soul is captured in a ruby necklace and he seeks a new host to regroup. 

Serapis: The Sun Scribe. Serapis is a genderless Sun worshipper who prior to the Sundering was experimenting with Light magic, including building an observatory on the mountain above the valley. (fire and light magic, illusion). Aloof, disinterested in the pursuits of mortals, very interested in the affections of Cyella. 

Arctos: The Artificer. Arctos takes the form of an old man, a constant tinkerer wearing a long beard and cobblers apron replete with small tools. Arctos' magical studies focused on fusing materials and powers together (hybrid animals, waterfalls of flame, grafting)

Galdr: The boneless Witch. During the Sundering, Galdr was practicing transportation magic and while scrying into another world was involuntarily swept aboard  [the repentant] where she was claimed as a witch and, being unable to burn her, was chained in iron beneath the ship.
