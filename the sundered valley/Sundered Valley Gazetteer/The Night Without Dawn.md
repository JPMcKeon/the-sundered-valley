# What we know
- Before the current era, most residents of Riverwall lived elsewhere outside of the Sundered Valley
- At some point two years ago, a cataclysm "broke the world" and caused the residents of Riverwall to leave their original homes
- Whatever polity existed before the cataclysm has been effectively disbanded, though it may live on in remnants
- For a time long enough to erase all memories before it, the world was cast into darkness, "The Night Before Dawn"
- One year later, the Sun emerged and the people rejoiced in salvation, [[The Risen]] are formed.
- Some months later, a resource gathering party discovered a cave while trying to summit a nearby mountain. This cave held [[The Tooth]]
- When [[The Tooth]] was brought back to Riverwall, excitement surrounding the mysterious blood-like issue was rampant, forming [[Sanguine]].
